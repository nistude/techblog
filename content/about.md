Hello,

I am about two decades into my career in IT, working in various roles in and
around operations. I began my career as a classical systems administrator,
drank the devops kool-aid in 2009, dipped my nose into web programming and
lastly settled on a position as team lead in a web company.

While my day job provides me ample access to new technologies, I am also
interested in complex adaptive systems and decision making under uncertainty.

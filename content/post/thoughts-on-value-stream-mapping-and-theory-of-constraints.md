Recently, we had a workshop with [J.B.Rainsberger](http://www.jbrains.ca/)
at work where he introduced us to
[Value Stream Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping)
and
[Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)
for improving our software development processes.

At the
[Holidaycheck techblog](http://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2017/12/14/thoughts-on-vsm-and-toc-jbhc)
I take on my [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)
glasses and comment on that approach.
